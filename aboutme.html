<p> Hey, I'm Yuki. I'm a Girls Who Code member in Moody's this summer and a rising senior in Brooklyn Technical High School.  </p>
<p> In my free time, I like to go on Quora and read almost everything that's on my feed, ranging from sad life stories to college
  advice to awesome life hacks because I enjoy gaining new knowledge while memorizing random trivia on the back of my mind. I also
  love doing sports with my family and friends. I've been playing badminton with my mom ever since 1st grade and I started fencing
  just last year. Even though I'm on the fencing team in my school, I have to admit I'm the second worst player in the team.
  Additionally, I like to go out to the city and walk for several hours straight while listening to music. One of my proudest
  accomplishments in life is walking 110 streets in one afternoon. Recently, I created a scrapbook for my mom's Christmas present
  and now I'm obessed with hot glueing flowers,doilies and anything pastable I could find in my house onto my scrapbook. Often, it
  may take hours to complete one page, but the journey of making something special for your loved one is definitely worth it. </p>

<p> After dabbling with both Python and Scratch, I realized there are many similarities between the two programming languages. 
  I can build loops, conditionals, variables and functions along with making things go forward and turn left or right. However, 
  there are no sprites readily available in Python and the syntax is very different as well. I can't drag and drop any blocks in Python
  like what I did in Scratch.
<p>My group and I also started debugging our programs and it was pretty frustrating when more errors popped up after "fixing" one part of 
  the code. Although, it was time consuming, I did like challenging myself and thinking critically. Problem solving is a great skill to practice.

  <h5> July 21st, 2017 </h5>
 <p> In class today, we learned about data struuctures and how to create a list in Python. A list is basically an array of data and 
   it is very useful when you need to store a list of coordinates or a list of pixels in a picture for example. It stores a large set 
   of data in one place so it's easy to access the information in one go. After learning about them, we used our knowledge and created our own filters.

<h5> July 25th, 2017 </h5>
<p> Today we built a BOE robot and I liked this activity a lot! We learned how to create circuits and how we can light up a LED using jumper wires, 
 resistors and a battery. Although, my group and I spent an hour figuring out how to light up the LED using a series and parallel circuit, I enjoyed 
 trying out different wire positions to get the  circuit to work.
<p> After learning how to light up one LED, we grouped up and tried to create a luxurious light show but only 2 out of our 13 pins worked so we 
  dimmed our expectations and wrote simpler code with our limited resources. Even after simplifying everything, Arduino had a hard time 
  uploading our code so in the end, nothing worked out like we wanted to. Even with all these troubles, my group persevered to make the lights blink. </p>
