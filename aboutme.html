  <p class="motto"><em>"Dont be shy, take pride."</em></p>

<p> Hey, I'm Yuki. I'm a Girls Who Code member in Moody's this summer and a rising senior in Brooklyn Technical High School.  </p>
<p> In my free time, I like to go on Quora and read almost everything that's on my feed, ranging from sad life stories to college
  advice to awesome life hacks because I enjoy gaining new knowledge while memorizing random trivia on the back of my mind. I also
  love doing sports with my family and friends. I've been playing badminton with my mom ever since 1st grade and I started fencing
  just last year. Even though I'm on the fencing team in my school, I have to admit I'm the second worst player in the team. I may be bad,
  but I love how strategic the sport is. I always have to try out new moves and think of new ways to hit my opponent when I'm on the strip.
  Fencing is very similar to coding as my problem solving and critical thinking skills play very important roles in completing a task.
  The main reason I like coding and fencing so much is because I enjoy challenging myself while learning from my own mistakes. </p>
  <p>Additionally, I like to go out to the city and walk for several hours straight while listening to music. One of my proudest
  accomplishments in life so far is walking 110 streets in one afternoon by myself. I get to distress myself from school and reflect upon
  my life as I trudge through the bustling city and observe everyone around me. Because I really cherish my memories, I recently created a scrapbook
  for my mom so we can look back at some old pictures together and now I'm obsessed with hot gluing
  flowers,doilies and anything pastable I could find in my house onto it. Often, it
  would take me hours to complete one page, but the journey of making something valuable for both me and my mom is definitely worth it. </p>

<h5> July 19th, 2017 </h5>
<p> After dabbling with both Python and Scratch, I realized there are many similarities between the two programming languages. I can build loops,
  conditionals, variables and functions along with making things go forward and turn left or right. However, there are no sprites readily available
  in Python and the syntax is very different as well. I can't drag and drop any blocks in Python like what I did in Scratch.
<p>My group and I also started debugging our programs and it was pretty frustrating when more errors popped up after "fixing" one part of the code.
  Although, it was time consuming, I did like challenging myself and thinking critically. Problem solving is a great skill to practice.

<h5> July 21st, 2017 </h5>
<p> In class today, we learned about data structures and how we can create a list in Python. A list is basically an array of data and it is very
    useful when you need to store a list of coordinates or a list of pixels in a picture for example. It stores a large set of data in one place so
    it's easy to access the information in one go. After learning about them, we stored all the rgb pixels of one picture in a list, classified each set of pixels
    in one intensity category from low to high and changed the color of each intensity level to create our own filters, just like Obama's Hope campaign poster.

<h5> July 25th, 2017 </h5>
<p> Today we built a BOE robot and I liked this activity a lot! We learned about circuits and how we can light up a LED using jumper wires, resistors
  and a battery. Although, my group and I spent an hour figuring out how to light up the LED using a series and parallel circuit, I enjoyed trying out
  different wire positions to get the  circuit to work.

  <p> One thing I learned about circuits is that power comes from GND so in order to power
    the circuit, you need to connect a jumper wire from Ground to the breadboard. I also learned that current flows away from the negative side of the
    battery to the positive side so the positive lead of a LED should be further away from GND. After testing our circuits, we made our robot
     dance by using servos and adding in go forward, go backwards, turn left and turn right functions. We made out robot turn 360 degrees and sway from left to
     right. It was fun watching other group's robots dance as well.

  <h5> August 1, 2017 </h5>
<p> After experimenting with Javascript today, I learned how to add a button that changes the background color each time you click on it and an alert box that pops
  up everytime the page loads. Some of my peers have really cool features as well. Carolina has a menu bar that slides in an out of the page and Brittany has icons
  and buttons that link her website to projects she made throughout the program. One challenge I faced today was trying to randomize the rgb values so a random background 
    color would appear every time the user clicks the button. I'm still stuck on the problem but I'll keep working on this.
