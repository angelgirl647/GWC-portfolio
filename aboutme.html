<p> Hey, I'm Yuki. I'm a Girls Who Code member in Moody's this summer and a rising senior in Brooklyn Technical High School.  </p>
<p> In my free time, I like to go on Quora and read almost everything that's on my feed, ranging from sad life stories to college 
  advice to awesome life hacks because I enjoy gaining new knowledge while memorizing random trivia on the back of my mind. I also 
  love doing sports with my family and friends. I've been playing badminton with my mom ever since 1st grade and I started fencing 
  just last year. Even though I'm on the fencing team in my school, I have to admit I'm the second worst player in the team. 
  Additionally, I like to go out to the city and walk for several hours straight while listening to music. One of my proudest 
  accomplishments in life is walking 110 streets in one afternoon. Recently, I created a scrapbook for my mom's Christmas present
  and now I'm obessed with hot glueing flowers,doilies and anything pastable I could find in my house onto my scrapbook. Often, it
  may take hours to complete one page, but the journey of making something special for your loved one is definitely worth it. </p>

<p> After dabbling with both Python and Scratch, I realized there are many similarities between the two programming languages. I can build loops, conditionals, variables and functions along with making things go forward and turn left or right. However, there are no sprites readily available in Python and the syntax is very different as well. I can't drag and drop any blocks in Python like what I did in Scratch.
<p>My group and I also started debugging our programs and it was pretty frustrating when more errors popped up after "fixing" one part of the code. Although, it was time consuming, I did like challenging myself and thinking critically. Problem solving is a great skill to practice.

 <p> In class today, we learned about data struuctures and how to create a list in Python. A list is basically an array of data and it is very useful when you need to store a list of coordinates or a list of pixels in a picture for example. It stores a large set of data in one place so it's easy to access the information in one go. After learning about them, we used our knowledge and created our own filters.
